# gifMaker

Hi! I was trying to make some gifs from a set of images. The only tool I found was ezgifmaker. However, I had to upload all the files and then run the program offline. Thus, I wrote this short program for you to quicky make gifs if you have a set of images. 

 **Usage**. 
 1. Clone the repository.
 2. Install the dependencies. You can either install them globally or in your virtual environment. 
 3. Run the program.

 **Notes**. 
I was working with images that have a transparent background. So the program is written for those. Feel free to tweak it as you like.

 **Bonus**. 
 I have also uploaded the executable file created using py installer.
